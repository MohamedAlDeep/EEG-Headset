## 10/21/2025 - Research Process and Read Datasheet / Initialized KICAD  




> **Time spent: 4h**

The day started by initializing the project, the first steps I have done was searching for 
equivalent projects made for the same purpose of brain-computer interfaces, I have found premade opensource headset made by a company called *OpenBCI* they have their Cyton Board sold for $1,249 USD which is very expensive that is why i decided to make my own, i learned from people on discord the general schematic and footprint needed for starting design process, then i read part of the Texas Instruments datasheet

## 10/22/2025 2 AM - Schematic Design   


# October 21th: 
> **Time spent: 3h 30min**

Started designing the schematic, first of all i found ADS1299 chip footprint but i had to edit certain pin names on the footprint, then i started connecting main pins to labels, after that i read the datasheet and also used the OpenBCI pcb reference in order to connect the electronic components to the pins in terms of 
capacitors and resistors, then i connected each pin to it's ground in which i have to ground planes one for digital and the other for analog signals.

## 10/22/2025 7 PM - Schematic Design Power Regulation  


### Power Regulation
> Security measures for power inputs 

After making the general schematic i thought about protecting the curcuit even though the power input is a battery i though it is relatively important to make such small circuit. As i have to power inputs one for *3.3v* and the other for *5v*, i had to make two separate regulators, the regulation curcuit consists of two parts, the regulator itself and a *reverse polarity protection* circuit made using *IRLM6402* Diode and *IRF954DN*. Both cicuits working on *uni-polar* power system.

## 10/24/2025 - Started Designing PCB  

> **Time spent: 4h**

### Many Iterations ðŸ˜…
I begined with adding the number of components needed for most pins from the 64 on the adc chip, then started organizing the capacitors at their positions then the 4 resistors for the unused GPIO pins, after that i draw the signal lines i tried for the first time then relialized i was drawing longer lines than needed that took a lot of space, so i tried to re-orrient the capacitors and do adjustments then found good position at least for now, i feel i might need to re-arrange in the future for the total size of the board 
but i find it good for now.

### Power Connection 
I tried to connect the reverse polarity protection circuit in many ways, at first i failed in some way either by drawing unnecessary traces or traces have intersection points, so at the end i was able to draw one not bad circuit that shouldn't take much space in the final pcb. I have done the same to the other power supply which is the 5v i tried to make both supplies as similar as posible. However, i still don't know what i should do in terms of ground plane, i know that according to the *Texas Instruments* datasheet i should make two ground planes one for digital and other for analog, this is what i am going to do next.

### Pins Connectors 
At the end i have added pin connectors which are the ones that work with the dupont wires and finaly i have added temporary large holes that enable me to hold the pcb with screws or inside a 3D printed case that i am going to design in the following times.
