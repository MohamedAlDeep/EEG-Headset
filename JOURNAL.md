## 10/21/2025 - Research Process and Read Datasheet / Initialized KICAD  




> **Time spent: 4h**

The day started by initializing the project, the first steps I have done was searching for 
equivalent projects made for the same purpose of brain-computer interfaces, I have found premade opensource headset made by a company called *OpenBCI* they have their Cyton Board sold for $1,249 USD which is very expensive that is why i decided to make my own, i learned from people on discord the general schematic and footprint needed for starting design process, then i read part of the Texas Instruments datasheet

## 10/22/2025 2 AM - Schematic Design   


# October 21th: 
> **Time spent: 3h 30min**

Started designing the schematic, first of all i found ADS1299 chip footprint but i had to edit certain pin names on the footprint, then i started connecting main pins to labels, after that i read the datasheet and also used the OpenBCI pcb reference in order to connect the electronic components to the pins in terms of 
capacitors and resistors, then i connected each pin to it's ground in which i have to ground planes one for digital and the other for analog signals.

## 10/22/2025 7 PM - Schematic Design Power Regulation  


### Power Regulation
> Security measures for power inputs 

After making the general schematic i thought about protecting the curcuit even though the power input is a battery i though it is relatively important to make such small circuit. As i have to power inputs one for *3.3v* and the other for *5v*, i had to make two separate regulators, the regulation curcuit consists of two parts, the regulator itself and a *reverse polarity protection* circuit made using *IRLM6402* Diode and *IRF954DN*. Both cicuits working on *uni-polar* power system.

## 10/24/2025 - Started Designing PCB  

> **Time spent: 4h**

### Many Iterations 😅
I begined with adding the number of components needed for most pins from the 64 on the adc chip, then started organizing the capacitors at their positions then the 4 resistors for the unused GPIO pins, after that i draw the signal lines i tried for the first time then relialized i was drawing longer lines than needed that took a lot of space, so i tried to re-orrient the capacitors and do adjustments then found good position at least for now, i feel i might need to re-arrange in the future for the total size of the board 
but i find it good for now.

### Power Connection 
I tried to connect the reverse polarity protection circuit in many ways, at first i failed in some way either by drawing unnecessary traces or traces have intersection points, so at the end i was able to draw one not bad circuit that shouldn't take much space in the final pcb. I have done the same to the other power supply which is the 5v i tried to make both supplies as similar as posible. However, i still don't know what i should do in terms of ground plane, i know that according to the *Texas Instruments* datasheet i should make two ground planes one for digital and other for analog, this is what i am going to do next.

### Pins Connectors 
At the end i have added pin connectors which are the ones that work with the dupont wires and finaly i have added temporary large holes that enable me to hold the pcb with screws or inside a 3D printed case that i am going to design in the following times.

## 11/1/2025 - Final Changes and Polishing PCB  

## Schematic 
Since the last time i have made some checks and revalidation for the schematic design and i got feedback from field professionals, i found that my schematic had major issue in certain connections, in addition i didn't have a connector for the start pin, so i added the connector then i started fixing the differential connectors for the inputs named in INxP/N format, i had to follow a certain pattern in making those connections, in which it is written in the datasheet that the connections are made in *sequential montage* way in which every differential input connection has a resistor and every two pairs of INxP/N have a decoupling capacitor, i applied that to every input, which made the final result shown in the image.

## PCB
In the PCB trace routing process i rerouted the whole board again, the process was much faster though and i worked on making a neat concise routes.

I started by adding the start pin connector, then went to the INxP/N differential inputs, i started updated the pcb from schematic which added about 16 resistors and 8 capacitors, i organized each resistor onto its respective area then drawn the traces after that i took each capacitor connected each one to its differential pairs, after that i connected them to the already made traces to the chip.

After finishing the main connections i only had to connect the power supply to the chip, which got me into another work, my bottom connections of the chip are not organized as the datasheet which made me not able to connect the power supply lines effectively, so i took the TI's Datasheet example on pcb layout as reference and rerouted the traces, so i put the decoupling capacitors at the same orientation, and added large polygons for the **AVDD** (positive power) connection, then to follow the datasheet i had to use a minimum of 2-layers one on the bottom for using it as ground for each supply, so i added filled ground regions (blue boxes in the image) based on that i added on the front layer **vias** for **AVSS** ground connection for the respective chip pins, so at the end i had connected the power supplies for the bottom side of the chip. I have done the same process for the top side of the chip from *1. rerouting traces* then *2. orientation* then *3. power connections and vias*, after doing all that i re-positioned the reverse polarity protection circuit and routed the powering pins to their inputs by routing them on the bottom layer and i refilled the ground plane to disconnect from the power traces. 
So at the end i had completed every connection and i was ready to polish the PCB in which i made rounded edge cuts for pcb outline around the mounting holes, then i added my logo using the image converted on KiCAD.

## Plastic Mount / Holder
So i took a break then made a simple design for pcb mounting part in Fusion360 program, this was a fast forward process, the part is just a bottom rest case i didn't have a specific idea for it, so i might add a cover on the top but i feel like i will leave it like that and just mount it using bolts and nuts
