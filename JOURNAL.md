## 10/21/2025 - Research Process and Read Datasheet / Initialized KICAD  




> **Time spent: 4h**

The day started by initializing the project, the first steps I have done was searching for 
equivalent projects made for the same purpose of brain-computer interfaces, I have found premade opensource headset made by a company called *OpenBCI* they have their Cyton Board sold for $1,249 USD which is very expensive that is why i decided to make my own, i learned from people on discord the general schematic and footprint needed for starting design process, then i read part of the Texas Instruments datasheet

## 10/22/2025 2 AM - Schematic Design   


# October 21th: 
> **Time spent: 3h 30min**

Started designing the schematic, first of all i found ADS1299 chip footprint but i had to edit certain pin names on the footprint, then i started connecting main pins to labels, after that i read the datasheet and also used the OpenBCI pcb reference in order to connect the electronic components to the pins in terms of 
capacitors and resistors, then i connected each pin to it's ground in which i have to ground planes one for digital and the other for analog signals.

## 10/22/2025 7 PM - Schematic Design Power Regulation  


### Power Regulation
> Security measures for power inputs 

After making the general schematic i thought about protecting the curcuit even though the power input is a battery i though it is relatively important to make such small circuit. As i have to power inputs one for *3.3v* and the other for *5v*, i had to make two separate regulators, the regulation curcuit consists of two parts, the regulator itself and a *reverse polarity protection* circuit made using *IRLM6402* Diode and *IRF954DN*. Both cicuits working on *uni-polar* power system.
